# fun-with-core-logic

This repo is the result of an evening spent giving a brief tour of
[core.logic](https://github.com/clojure/core.logic/blob/master/src/main/clojure/clojure/core/logic.clj)
to a few friends.  Most of what's here is boilerplate, autogenerated
by `lein new fun-with-core-logic`.

Here's [our repl buffer](https://github.com/lkuper/fun-with-core-logic/blob/master/repl-09-04-2013), and the code we actually wrote is [here](https://github.com/lkuper/fun-with-core-logic/blob/master/src/fun_with_core_logic/core.clj).
